# Save The Lynx Game

## _About:_

Save The Lynx Game is a relatively simple game created to learn
the ReactJS framework along with brushing up on my Flask knowledge.
During this years Advent Of Code, I enjoyed utilizing the flood-fill algorithm
to complete several of the questions. That is also what enlightened me to
include the algorithm in this project.

## _A project to delve into:_

-React and Flask frameworks.
-Utilization of the flood-fill algorithm.
-Migrating a project from Javascript to Typescript.
